# The behavior of RuboCop can be controlled via the .rubocop.yml
# configuration file. It makes it possible to enable/disable
# certain cops (checks) and to alter their behavior if they accept
# any parameters. The file can be placed either in your home
# directory or in some project directory.
#
# RuboCop will start looking for the configuration file in the directory
# where the inspected file is and continue its way up to the root directory.
#
# See https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/configuration

# RuboCop will then check your project for a series of files where
# the version may be specified already. The files that will be looked
# for are .ruby-version, .tool-versions, Gemfile.lock, and *.gemspec.
# If Gemspec file has an array for required_ruby_version, the lowest
# version will be used. If none of the files are found a default version
# value will be used.
